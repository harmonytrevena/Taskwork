## Taskwork


## Description
A user friendly project management tool, that utilizes a Kanban chart to track project performance and boost team efficiencies.

## Motivation
The primary driver behind Taskwork is to deliver a project management tool with a relatively low barrier to entry. Taskwork is designed to be easy to navigate with special attention given to a fluid UI/UX experience. In addition, a completly responsive, mobile first design allows users to track projects on the go.

## How to use?
There are two primary pages two navigate Taskwork. At first, the project page is used to create projects, add descriptions, and track project status. Each project is linked to it's own task page, where users can add tasks, advance tasks through in progress, in testing and completed states. Once project tasks reach a completed state users can mark the project for review, and finally as completed once all project requirements have been met and approved.
